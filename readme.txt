PokeAPI Assignment Summary
In this assignment I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a web application that interacts with the PokeAPI. The project involved the following key components:

HTML Template: An HTML template was designed to structure the web page. Part of this template was imported into the JavaScript file to facilitate DOM manipulation.

Custom CSS: A custom CSS file was created to style Pokémon types and other elements where Bootstrap alternatives were not available.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap was used to enhance the layout and responsiveness.

JavaScript: JavaScript was used to fetch data from the PokeAPI. The script retrieved Pokémon names, IDs, types, and images, and inject the data into the DOM to display this information.

Comments placed to interpret code and cleaned up code to remove unused code/classes/ids/attributes

Requirements Completed:

Included a search input in the navbar, triggered by an event listener on either the search button click or Enter key press.

Utilized the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data.

Displayed the Pokémon's image, ID number, name, and types on the page.

Added a loading message and error messages for both empty input or invalid entries.

Tools Used:

ChatGPT: Assisted with starter code, research, and grammar.

https://youtu.be/drXkf_rytRs?si=WMzEbtgV3jnjoOB7-YouTube Walkthrough: Used as a reference and source of inspiration.

Images sourced from Google and Bing searches.

Bootstrap 5 Documentation: Referenced for styling and layout guidance.

Reflection:

Continued focus will be placed on improving CSS layout(Flexbox and Grid) usage, as well as reinforcing fundamental JavaScript concepts and revisiting them until they are ingrained.

Progress was made in using the command line, organizing project files, and working more efficiently in VS Code—especially through keyboard shortcuts. I also began using the Live Preview extension as an alternative to Live Server. It streamlined development by displaying updates directly within VS Code, though it lacks access to browser dev tools.
